# Comprehensive GitLab CI/CD Pipeline with Code Quality and Pentesting using GitLab Runner

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a **comprehensive GitLab CI/CD pipeline** setup using **GitLab Runner**, focusing on **high-quality**, **secure**, and **reliable software delivery**. The pipeline integrates **SonarQube** for continuous code quality analysis and **automated pentesting** to enhance security. By leveraging GitLab Runner, the process ensures scalable execution and efficient management of builds and tests across multiple environments.

## Features

- **GitLab CI/CD Pipeline:** Automates the entire software lifecycle, from building to testing, quality analysis, security scanning, and deployment.
- **GitLab Runner Integration:** Facilitates distributed builds and testing, enabling faster and scalable pipeline execution.
- **SonarQube Integration:** Provides continuous code quality analysis for bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Security Testing (Pentest):** Incorporates tools like **OWASP ZAP** for automatic penetration testing and security vulnerability checks.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Reporting:** Dashboards in both GitLab and SonarQube provide real-time insights into code quality and security.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Build:**
   - Compiles and packages the application, ensuring a reproducible and reliable build process.
   
2. **Test:**
   - Executes **unit tests** and **integration tests** to verify code functionality and detect potential regressions.
   
3. **Code Quality Analysis:**
   - Uses **SonarQube** to scan the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
   - Enforces predefined **quality gates** that must be passed before moving forward in the pipeline.
   
4. **Security Testing (Pentest):**
   - Runs security scans using tools like **OWASP ZAP** to detect vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and more.
   
5. **Deployment:**
   - Deploys to **staging** and **production** environments after passing all quality and security checks.
   - Implements rollback mechanisms to ensure reliable deployments.

## Requirements

- **GitLab:** For CI/CD pipeline management and version control.
- **GitLab Runner:** To execute jobs in the pipeline, enabling scalable and isolated job execution.
- **SonarQube:** For continuous inspection of code quality.
- **OWASP ZAP (or similar):** For pentesting.
- **Docker (optional):** To manage consistent environments during the build and test phases.

## How to Set Up

### Step 1: GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Setup

Create the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file at the root of your repository. This file defines the stages of the pipeline, leveraging GitLab Runner for job execution.

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - code_quality
  - pentest
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."
    - ./build_script.sh
  tags:
    - docker

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running unit and integration tests..."
    - ./run_tests.sh
  tags:
    - docker

sonarqube_analysis:
  stage: code_quality
  script:
    - echo "Running SonarQube analysis..."
    - sonar-scanner
  tags:
    - docker

owasp_zap:
  stage: pentest
  script:
    - echo "Running OWASP ZAP security scan..."
    - ./run_pentest.sh
  tags:
    - docker

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production..."
    - ./deploy_script.sh
  tags:
    - docker
```

### Step 2: Set Up GitLab Runner

1. **Install GitLab Runner:**
   Install GitLab Runner on your local server or cloud infrastructure to run CI/CD jobs.

2. **Register GitLab Runner:**
   Use the following command to register your GitLab Runner:

   ```bash
   gitlab-runner register
   ```

   Choose Docker or another suitable executor based on your environment.

3. **Assign Tags to Runners:**
   Ensure that the GitLab Runner is correctly tagged (e.g., `docker`) for executing specific jobs in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

### Step 3: SonarQube Integration

1. **Install SonarQube** and configure it to scan your project.
2. Set up a **sonar-scanner** in your GitLab CI/CD pipeline to trigger code quality checks:

   ```bash
   sonar-scanner \
   -Dsonar.projectKey=YourProjectKey \
   -Dsonar.sources=. \
   -Dsonar.host.url=http://your-sonarqube-server:9000 \
   -Dsonar.login=YourSonarQubeToken
   ```

3. Ensure that **quality gates** in SonarQube are enforced to block poor-quality code from being merged.

### Step 4: Security Pentesting with OWASP ZAP

1. **Set up OWASP ZAP** in your CI/CD pipeline for automated penetration testing.
2. Define your scan targets and common vulnerabilities to check during the pentest stage.

   Example script for OWASP ZAP:

   ```bash
   ./zap-cli --api-key YourZapApiKey quick-scan --self-contained --spider target_url
   ```

3. Ensure reports are generated for each scan, and review them regularly.

### Step 5: Deployment

In the deployment stage, configure GitLab to deploy the application to your staging or production environment. Consider using **blue-green** or **canary deployments** to ensure zero-downtime releases and safe rollback procedures.

```yaml
deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production..."
    - ./deploy_script.sh
  only:
    - master
  tags:
    - docker
```

## Monitoring and Reporting

- **GitLab Dashboards:** Track build, test, and deployment statuses in real-time using GitLabâ€™s built-in dashboards.
- **SonarQube Dashboards:** View real-time code quality metrics including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and technical debt.
- **Security Reports:** Review automated pentest reports from OWASP ZAP to maintain strong application security.

## Best Practices

- Ensure comprehensive **unit** and **integration tests** to validate functionality and performance.
- Use **SonarQube quality gates** to enforce strict coding standards and ensure robust code quality.
- Schedule regular **security scans** in the CI/CD pipeline to detect and fix vulnerabilities before they hit production.
- Use **GitLab Runner** for scalable, distributed builds and tests, ensuring fast execution across environments.

## Conclusion

This pipeline setup, combined with **GitLab Runner**, SonarQube, and security testing tools, provides a robust framework for building **fast**, **reliable**, and **secure** software. By integrating automated code quality checks and pentesting, you can maintain the highest standards of security and performance in your software development lifecycle. Start leveraging this comprehensive setup to boost the quality and reliability of your projects today.
